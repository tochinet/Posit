Documentation for the Posit library

**Work in progress at the moment, more to come later.**

The [Arduino Posit Library](https://github.com/tochinet/Posit/tree/main) provides an alternative to floating point numbers and doubles 
(although the 64-bit double format doesn't really exist in 8-bit Arduino cores)
using a *tapered* number system, meaning that the precision is higher around plus/minus one and lower for very low or very high powers of two.
